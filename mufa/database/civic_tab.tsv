ABL1	BCR-ABL	1	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1	25	"The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome, is one of the most studied fusion genes in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors."		22	23522397	23632600			ENST00000305877.8	75	GRCh37	9	133729451	133763063	ENST00000318560.5	transcript_fusion	N/A	2020-02-08 03:53:21 UTC	255.5		N/A	"T(9;22)(Q34;Q11),BCR-ABL1"

NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone.

This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence.

FLT3	ITD	55	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/55	2322	"FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant."		13	28608219	28608351			ENST00000241453.7	75	GRCh37					inframe_insertion		2019-06-21 23:13:36 UTC	441.5		16270

PAX8	PAX8-PPARG	209	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/209	7849	PAX8-PPAR gamma is a oncogene caused by a translocation between 2q13 and 3p25 resulting in an in-frame fusion between the two genes. It has been observed in Follicular Thyroid Cancer (FTC) and is one of two known fusion products involving PPAR gamma in FTC indicating this region may be a breakpoint hotspot. Studies have indicated that the fusion product increases cell viability and proliferation and decreases apoptosis.		2	113992971	114036521			ENST00000429538.3	75	GRCh37	3	12329400	12475810	ENST00000397015.2	transcript_fusion		2020-05-06 20:51:55 UTC	15		N/A	T(2;3)(Q13;P25)

TERT	PROMOTER MUTATION	220	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/220	7015	"TERT promoter mutations are activating and commonly found at two hotspots within the TERT promoter region which occur 124 and 146 base pairs (hg19) upstream of the translation start site. These hotspots, termed C228T and C250T are observed in many cancer types and have a particularly high prevalence in glioblastoma (83%), melanoma (71%), bladder cancer (66%) and hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) (47%). The two mutations are usually heterozygous and mutually exclusive and result in an increased similarity to an ETS binding domain and may act as a binding site to an ETS transcription factor. These mutations are thought to be early events in tumorgenesis and aid in cellular immortality. Decreased overall survival in patients with these mutations have been observed in medulloblastoma, thyroid cancer, urogenital cancer, melanoma, and laryngeal tumors. The presence of these mutations has also been shown to be predictive of malignant/premalignant nodules in HCC and meningiomas."		5	1295161	1295373			ENST00000310581.5	75	GRCh37					regulatory_region_variant		2020-04-28 23:02:41 UTC	95			"-124C>T,-146C>T"

ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	306	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/306	2064	"Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer."		17	37856333	37884915			ENST00000269571.5	75	GRCh37					transcript_amplification		2020-04-14 16:58:34 UTC	885		N/A	OVEREXPRESSION	32	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/assertions/32

In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC. Interestingly PIK3CA mutations in HNSCC have been observed to be absent from a number of ethnic groups including greek, german, and vietnamese populations."		3	178866311	178957881			ENST00000263967.3	75	GRCh37					"transcript_variant,gain_of_function_variant"		2019-12-13 09:39:04 UTC	369		N/A		22	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/assertions/22

As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies."		17	37880996	37880997		TACGTGATGGCT	ENST00000269571.5	75	GRCh37					inframe_insertion	"NM_001005862.2:c.2224_2235dupTACGTGATGGCT,ENST00000269571.5:c.2314_2325dupTACGTGATGGCT,NC_000017.10:g.37880985_37880996dupTACGTGATGGCT,NC_000017.10:g.37880993_37880994insGCTTACGTGATG"	2018-11-30 14:45:23 UTC	36	CA135369	44985	"A775INSYVMA,P.A775_G776INSYVMA,P.E770_A771INSAYVM,TYR772_ALA775DUP,A775_G776INSYVMA,M774INSAYVM"

They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1.

ALK	ALK FUSIONS	499	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/499	238	"Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib ?a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC."

Variant 2 has cytoplasmic distribution and makes up ~10% of EML4-ALK fusions found in NSCLC,. Although the specific variant is not consistently reported, single cases demonstrating response to crizotinib treatment in NSCLC and a differentiated malignant neoplasm of unknown origin have been reported. In vitro, this variant has shown greater sensitivity to ALK inhibition with TAE684 and crizotinib than the EML4-ALK variants 1 (E13;A20), 3a (E6;A20) and 3b (E6ins33;A20).

Preclinical work indicates that CLTC-ALK DLBCL is responsive to ALK inhibition in cell lines and mouse models, and two case studies show short response followed by progression when heavily pretreated and advanced ALK-positive DLBCL is treated with crizotinib (one case CLTC-ALK, one case an unknown ALK fusion)."

These fusions have been described in histologically distinctive soft tissue tumours showing a pericytic phenotype.  Gene fusions retain the DNA-binding zinc finger domains of GLI1 and it is likely that the replacement of the promoter region of GLI1with that of the ubiquitously expressed ACTB gene leads to deregulation of GLI expression and its downstream target genes."														gene_fusion		2017-12-01 14:40:34 UTC	15		N/A	T(7;12)(P21-22;Q13-15)

TP53	CONSERVED DOMAIN MUT	1300	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1300	7157	"This conserved domain mutation variant covers mutations in regions of p53 reported to be highly conserved during evolution. These regions span codons 117-143 (region II), 171-181 (region III), 234-258 (region (IV), and 270-286 (region V). Region I covers approximately codons 10 through 25 but does not appear in all studies on conserved domain mutations. There is overlap with these regions and reported regions of hotspot p53 mutations, where it is observed that hotspots for detrimental mutation correspond to more highly evolutionary conserved regions. While there is agreement and overlap between different reports, the literature does not seem to indicate an exact consensus on these regions of human p53 at this time, but the four highly conserved regions are part of the DNA binding domain, and are reported to exist within codons 97 to 292."		17	7577062	7579398			ENST00000269305.4	75								2018-07-06 14:54:43 UTC	15

VHL	R167Q (c.500G>A)	1739	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1739	7428	R167Q is the most common point mutation in hereditary Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and disrupts the VHL genes binding to elongin C reducing the levels of the VHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) E3 ligase complex and inhibiting the ability of VHL to regulate HIF2. This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2 and suprressed tumorgenesis.		3	10191507	10191507	G	A	ENST00000256474.2	75	GRCh37					missense_variant	"NM_000551.3:c.500G>A,NP_000542.1:p.Arg167Gln,NC_000003.11:g.10191507G>A,ENST00000256474.2:c.500G>A"	2020-04-11 04:47:32 UTC	87.5	CA020454	2216	"C.500G>A,ARG167GLN,RS5030821"	4	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/assertions/4

The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms."		3	10183739	10183739	G	A	ENST00000256474.2	75	GRCh37					missense_variant	"NM_000551.3:c.208G>A,NP_000542.1:p.Glu70Lys,NC_000003.11:g.10183739G>A,ENST00000256474.2:c.208G>A"	2019-05-16 23:33:44 UTC	45	CA020108	43598	"C.208G>A,GLU70LYS,RS5030802"	14	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/assertions/14

In many cases these tumors were negative for the more common known driver genes of these diseases (e.g., KRAS wild-type pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma). These events have been proposed as an attractive therapeutic target and some promising results have been observed with pan-HER inhibitors such as afatinib."																2020-04-17 00:24:27 UTC	10

The fusion is generated by a ~320-kb interstitial deletion in Xp22 (in the so-called pseudo-autosomal (PAR) region) which fuses the exon 1 of P2RY8 with the exon 1 of CRLF2. The P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion has been shown to be enriched in Down syndrome B-ALL cases. CRLF2 rearrangements are also significantly associated with activating mutations of JAK1 or JAK2, deletion or mutation of IKZF1, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity."														transcript_fusion		2020-06-12 16:40:33 UTC	0			PAR DELETION
